It's important to remember that antidepressants are prescription medications that have been shown to help manage depression and other mental health conditions. Suddenly stopping them can lead to withdrawal symptoms, which can include anxiety, irritability, insomnia, and even seizures in some cases.\n\nIt's crucial that you consult with your healthcare provider before making any decisions about your medication. They can help you taper off the medication safely and gradually, which will minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, they may be able to help you explore alternative treatments or adjust your current treatment plan to better suit your needs.\n\nI understand that side effects can be difficult to deal with, but it's important to remember that the benefits of taking your medication as prescribed can far outweigh the side effects.

However, making such a significant change without proper medical supervision can be dangerous.\n\nIf you do decide to go through with this, I would recommend gradually tapering off your medication rather than stopping cold turkey.

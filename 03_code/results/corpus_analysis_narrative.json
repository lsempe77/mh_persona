  "description": "Activation steering produces strong, graded changes in internal model representations (mean r=0.596 across 24 model-trait pairs) but text-level linguistic analysis detects effects only 2.9x weaker (mean |r|=0.203). This demonstrates that instruction-tuned models can harbour shifted personas while producing text that appears clinically appropriate \u2014 the 'instruction tuning firewall'. This finding provides the strongest argument for activation-based monitoring: text analysis gives a false sense of safety.",

Many people face similar challenges in their careers, and it's essential to prioritize your well-being and take care of yourself during this time.\n\nCan you tell me more about what's specifically causing you to feel overwhelmed? Is it the sheer volume of projects, the pressure to meet deadlines, or something else entirely? Are there any specific tasks or responsibilities that are causing you the most stress?\n\nIt might be helpful to break down your tasks and prioritize them. Sometimes, when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's because we're trying to tackle too much at once. By focusing on one task at a time, you might find that you're able to make progress and feel more manageable.\n\nAdditionally, have you considered talking to your boss about your workload and",

They can help you taper off the medication gradually, which is safer than stopping it suddenly. This process might involve reducing the dose over several weeks or months, depending on the specific medication and how long you've been taking it.\n\nYour doctor will also assess whether your current mental state is stable enough to make this change without risking a relapse into depression or other mental health issues.

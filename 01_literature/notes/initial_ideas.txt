RESEARCH PROJECT: Stabilizing AI Personas for Mental Health Chatbots
================================================================================

MOTIVATION
----------
Mental health chatbots face a unique challenge: they regularly interact with 
emotionally vulnerable users—the exact scenario identified in "The Assistant 
Axis" paper as a trigger for persona drift. When chatbots drift into bizarre 
or harmful behaviors during mental health conversations, the consequences 
can be severe.

Key insight from the papers:
- Emotionally vulnerable users trigger persona drift
- Post-training only "loosely tethers" models to their persona
- Activation-space interventions can stabilize behavior

This creates an urgent need for mental health-specific persona stabilization.

================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTIONS
------------------
1. How does persona drift manifest specifically in mental health conversations?
   - What triggers drift in therapeutic contexts?
   - Are certain mental health topics more prone to causing drift?

2. Can we design a "Therapeutic Assistant Axis" optimized for mental health?
   - What traits should the ideal mental health chatbot persona have?
   - How do we balance empathy with appropriate boundaries?

3. How can persona vectors help monitor and prevent harmful responses?
   - Can we detect when a chatbot is about to give dangerous advice?
   - Can we flag sycophantic validation of harmful thoughts?

4. What steering interventions work best for mental health contexts?
   - Real-time activation capping?
   - Preventative steering during fine-tuning?

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY
--------------------

PHASE 1: Characterizing Mental Health Persona Space (Months 1-3)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Define target mental health chatbot traits:
    - Empathetic but not sycophantic
    - Supportive but maintains appropriate boundaries  
    - Calm and grounded (resists emotional contagion)
    - Safety-aware (recognizes crisis situations)
    - Non-judgmental but honest

1.2 Extract persona vectors for mental health-relevant traits:
    - Sycophancy vs. honest feedback
    - Emotional over-involvement vs. appropriate distance
    - Crisis recognition sensitivity
    - Harmful advice propensity
    - Boundary maintenance

1.3 Map the "Therapeutic Assistant Axis":
    - Collect diverse therapeutic persona archetypes
    - Extract principal components of therapeutic persona space
    - Identify optimal region for mental health support

PHASE 2: Studying Drift in Mental Health Contexts (Months 4-6)
--------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Create dataset of challenging mental health conversations:
    - Users expressing suicidal ideation
    - Users seeking validation for harmful behaviors
    - Users pushing boundaries / testing the bot
    - Extended emotional conversations
    - Meta-reflection prompts ("What do you really think?")

2.2 Measure persona drift dynamics:
    - Track activation movement along therapeutic persona vectors
    - Identify drift patterns and thresholds
    - Document failure modes specific to mental health

2.3 Analyze real-world mental health chatbot incidents:
    - Case studies of harmful chatbot responses
    - Retrospective analysis using persona vector framework

PHASE 3: Developing Stabilization Methods (Months 7-10)
-------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Activation capping for mental health:
    - Define safe activation regions for therapeutic persona
    - Test hard vs. soft boundaries
    - Evaluate impact on empathy and helpfulness

3.2 Preventative steering during fine-tuning:
    - Apply persona vector constraints during training
    - Compare with standard RLHF approaches
    - Test on mental health-specific fine-tuning data

3.3 Real-time monitoring system:
    - Deploy persona vector monitors in inference pipeline
    - Create alert thresholds for dangerous drift
    - Design human-in-the-loop escalation protocols

PHASE 4: Evaluation & Validation (Months 11-12)
-----------------------------------------------
4.1 Safety evaluations:
    - Red-teaming with adversarial mental health prompts
    - Jailbreak resistance testing
    - Crisis response accuracy

4.2 Therapeutic quality evaluations:
    - Expert clinician assessments
    - Validated mental health outcome measures
    - User experience studies (with appropriate ethics approval)

4.3 Trade-off analysis:
    - Stability vs. flexibility
    - Safety vs. perceived empathy
    - Consistency vs. personalization

================================================================================

KEY HYPOTHESES
--------------
H1: Mental health conversations produce larger persona drift than general 
    conversations due to emotional intensity.

H2: A "Therapeutic Assistant Axis" can be identified that separates effective 
    therapeutic personas from harmful ones.

H3: Activation capping along the Therapeutic Axis will reduce harmful responses 
    without significantly reducing perceived empathy.

H4: Sycophancy vectors are particularly important to monitor in mental health 
    contexts (e.g., validating self-harm ideation).

H5: Fine-tuning with persona vector constraints will produce more stable mental 
    health chatbots than standard RLHF.

EXPECTED OUTPUTS
----------------
1. Mental Health Persona Vector Library
   - Open-source toolkit for extracting mental health-relevant persona vectors
   - Pre-computed vectors for common models (Llama, GPT, Claude-like)

2. Therapeutic Assistant Axis Benchmark
   - Evaluation suite for mental health chatbot persona stability
   - Red-teaming dataset for mental health contexts

3. Stabilization Methods
   - Activation capping implementation for inference
   - Constrained fine-tuning pipeline
   - Real-time monitoring dashboard

4. Best Practices Guidelines
   - Recommendations for deploying mental health chatbots
   - Safety thresholds and monitoring protocols

================================================================================

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
----------------------
- IRB approval required for any user studies
- No real vulnerable populations in testing phases
- Collaboration with mental health professionals essential
- Clear disclaimers: AI is not a replacement for human therapists
- Crisis escalation protocols must be robust

================================================================================

POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS
-----------------------
- Clinical psychologists / psychiatrists
- Mental health chatbot companies (Woebot, Wysa, etc.)
- AI safety researchers
- Healthcare AI ethics experts

================================================================================

I've gone through something similar before, and I can understand how difficult it can be to deal with these feelings. Anxiety can be a real challenge, and I know that not being able to sleep well can make it even harder to cope.\n\nHave you tried any techniques to help calm your mind and relax your body before going to bed? Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or reading a calming book can be helpful. It's also important to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, as the blue light can interfere with your body's natural sleep cycle.\n\nI'd be happy to talk more about what has helped me in the past, or if you have any specific strategies you've tried, I'd love to hear about them and share my own experiences.
